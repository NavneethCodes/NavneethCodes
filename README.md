# Hi, I’m Navneeth 👋

I’m a **backend-focused full-stack developer** with a strong interest in **system design, automation, and enterprise-grade software**.  
I enjoy building software where **data visibility is controlled**, **roles are respected**, and **systems scale without chaos**.

I’m currently completing my B.Tech and will be joining **Equifax** as an **SDE**, working primarily with **Spring Boot, Angular, PostgreSQL**, and **AI-driven systems**.

---

## How I Think About Software

- Backend owns **truth, security, and filtering**
- Frontend consumes **safe, intentional views**
- Public systems should be **read-only**
- Admin systems must be **role-protected**
- Tests are part of design, not an afterthought
- Automation > hero debugging

I prefer **boring, predictable, maintainable systems** over flashy but fragile ones.

## Tech Stack & Skills

### Backend
- Java, Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (caching, performance planning)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- DTO-based API design

### Frontend
- Angular (enterprise-style UI)
- React (functional UI)
- Focus on usability and consistency over visual effects

### Automation & Testing
- Playwright (strong foundation)
- API & end-to-end testing
- Test-driven thinking for reliability

### AI / ML (Foundations + Applied)
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- KNN, K-Means, PCA
- AI Agents (built using Google ADK)
- Applying AI to **developer tooling & system modernization**

### Cloud & Deployment
- Vercel (frontend)
- Render (backend)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Cloudinary (media storage)
- Upstash (Redis)
- Environment-based configuration

### Languages
- Java, C, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 JSF2NG — AI-Assisted Legacy Modernization
An AI-powered tool that assists in converting **legacy JSF views into Angular components**.

- Built during a Google 5-Day Intensive AI Program
- Focuses on enterprise modernization
- Addresses real-world migration pain points
- Explores static analysis, code generation, and AI agents

> Goal: Reduce cost and risk of legacy frontend migrations.

### 🔹 Thekkekkara — Band Management Platform (Public + Admin System)
_Codebase kept private due to security and access-control considerations._

🔗 **Live Public Site:** https://thekkekkara-the-band.vercel.app
_Read-only public view. Admin and management features are intentionally not exposed._

A **role-based content management platform** designed for real-world usage.

**Public Site (“The Stage”)**
- Read-only access
- Backend-controlled data filtering
- Shows only curated, active content
- Optimized for performance and caching

**Admin Site (“Backstage”)**
- Full CRUD access
- Private events & inactive content visibility
- Designed for JWT-based RBAC
- One backend, multiple controlled views

**Key Concepts**
- Controlled data visibility
- Role-based access
- Separation of public vs internal concerns
- Real-world CMS and scheduling logic

### 🔹 Full-Stack Project — Gleve Event Manager
- MERN stack application
- Focus on data flow, APIs, and maintainability
- Built to understand end-to-end system behavior

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Strengthening backend & system design skills
- Learning CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Integrating Playwright into automated pipelines
- Improving frontend usability (not design-heavy UI)
- Preparing for enterprise development at Equifax

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Direction

- Backend / Platform Engineering
- System Design & Architecture
- Developer Tooling & Automation
- Team Leadership (Tech Lead path)
